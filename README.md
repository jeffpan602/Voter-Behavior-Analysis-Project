* Variables/factors identified as affecting voter before include trust in government, one's belief in the impact of voting, demographics, etc
* Machine learning (kNN) performed on the data set to try to predict one's voting pattern given a set of survey answers

2. Matplotlib for data visualization
3. scikit-learn for machine learning/kNN analysis
